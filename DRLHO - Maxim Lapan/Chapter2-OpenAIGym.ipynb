    "\n",
    "At a high level, every environment provides these pieces of information and functionality:\n",
    "- A set of actions that is allowed to be executed in the environment. Gym supports both discrete and continuous actions, as well as their combination\n",
    "- The shape and boundaries of the observations that the environment provides the agent with\n",
    "- A method called step to execute an action, which returns the current observation, the reward, and the indication that the episode is over\n",
    "- A method called reset, which returns the environment to its initial state and obtains the first observation\n",
    "\n",
    "### ***The observation space***\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic abstract class Space includes two methods that are relevant to us:\n",
    "-  sample(): This returns a random sample from the space\n",
    "-  contains(x): This checks whether the argument, x, belongs to the space's domain\n",
    "\n",
    "More classes:\n",
    "- The Discrete class represents a mutually exclusive set of items, numbered from 0 to n – 1. Its only field, n, is a count of the items it describes. For example, Discrete(n=4) can be used for an action space of four directions to move in [left, right, up, or down].\n",
    "- The Box class represents an n-dimensional tensor of rational numbers with intervals [low, high]. For instance, this could be an accelerator pedal with one single value between 0.0 and 1.0, which could be encoded by Box(low=0.0, high=1.0, shape=(1,), dtype=np.float32)(the shape argument is assigned a tuple of length 1 with a single value of 1, which gives us a one-dimensional tensor with a single value). The dtype parameter specifies the space's value type and here we specify it as a NumPy 32-bit float. Another example of Box could be an Atari screen observation (we will cover lots of Atari environments later), which is an RGB (red, green, and blue) image of size 210×160: Box(low=0, high=255, shape=(210, 160, 3), dtype=np.uint8). In this case, the shape argument is a tuple of three elements: the first dimension is the height of the image, the second is the width, and the third equals 3, which all correspond to three color planes for red, green, and blue, respectively. So, in total, every observation is a three-dimensional tensor with 100,800 bytes.\n",
    "- The final child of Space is a Tuple class, which allows us to combine several Space class instances together. This enables us to create action and observation spaces of any complexity that we want. For example, imagine we want to create an action space specification for a car. The car has several controls that can be changed at every timestamp, including the steering wheel angle, brake pedal position, and accelerator pedal position. These three controls can be specified by three float values in one single Box instance. Besides these essential controls, the car has extra discrete controls, like a turn signal (which could be off, right, or left) or horn (on or off). To combine all of this into one action space specification class, we can create Tuple(spaces=(Box(low=-1.0, high=1.0, shape=(3,), dtype=np. float32), Discrete(n=3),Discrete(n=2))). This flexibility is rarely used; for example, in this book, you will see only the Box and Discrete actions and observation spaces, but the Tuple class can be useful in some cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, Discrete.sample() returns a random element from a discrete range, and Box.sample() will be a random tensor with proper dimensions and values lying inside the given range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every environment has two members of type Space: the action_space and observation_space. \n",
    "\n",
    "### ***The environment***\n",
    "\n",
    "Has the following memebers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- action_space: This is the field of the Space class and provides a specification for allowed actions in the environment.\n",
    "- observation_space: This field has the same Space class, but specifies the observations provided by the environment.\n",
    "- reset(): This resets the environment to its initial state, returning the initial observation vector.\n",
    "- step(): This method allows the agent to take the action and returns information about the outcome of the action – the next observation, the local reward, and the end-of-episode flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "The step() method is the central piece in the environment's functionality. It does\n",
    "several things in one call, which are as follows:\n",
    "- Telling the environment which action we will execute on the next step\n",
    "- Getting the new observation from the environment after this action\n",
    "- Getting the reward the agent gained with this step\n",
    "- Getting the indication that the episode is over\n",
    "\n",
    "The first item (action) is passed as the only argument to this method, and the rest are\n",
    "returned by the step() method. Precisely, this is a tuple (Python tuple and not the\n",
    "Tuple class we discussed in the previous section) of four elements (observation,\n",
    "reward, done, and info). They have these types and meanings:\n",
    "- observation: This is a NumPy vector or a matrix with observation data.\n",
    "- reward: This is the float value of the reward.\n",
    "- done: This is a Boolean indicator, which is True when the episode is over.\n",
    "- info: This could be anything environment-specific with extra information about the environment. The usual practice is to ignore this value in general RL methods (not taking into account the specific details of the particular environment).\n",
    "\n",
    "### ***Creating and environment***\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an environment, the gym package provides the make(env_name) function, whose only argument is the environment's name in string form. The full list of environments can be found at https://gym.openai.com/envs"
